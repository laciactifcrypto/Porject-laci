        <p>   Like any project, no matter the field, it must respond to a problem whatever it may be.
          <br /><br />
          The LACI project responds to a recurrent problem, which should however alarm any investor, that of the inflow of money. In all projects.
          <br />
          If the inflow of money only comes from one point, it is known that all this point of reference and where will become very unstable in time, making the project dependent on this point.
           <br /><br />
           The LACI project solves this inherently simple and basic problem by providing a second money entry point that will itself focus on 4 diverse crypto only investment lines. This makes the project in perpetual evolution regardless of the entry point NÂ°1.

         <p>A token economy where 90% of the tokens are available on PancakeSwap, a decentralized exchange platform (DEX), means that the majority of the token supply is available to traders and investors in the open market. This can create high liquidity for the token
            <br />
            The 5% of tokens distributed for the creator can be considered as a reward for the initial effort and investment.
            <br />
            The 3% of tokens distributed to the team of 4 technicians can be seen as a reward for their hard work and contribution to the development and maintenance of the platform or project related to crypto-currency. This distribution can help keep a technical team motivated and committed in the long run.
            <br />
            The remaining 2% of tokens are reserved for launching the LC token.
